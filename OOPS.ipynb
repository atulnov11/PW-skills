        "A1:\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes containing both data (attributes) and functions (methods). OOP facilitates modular, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2: What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A2:\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3: What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "A3:\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It contains real values for the attributes defined in the class and can use the class's methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4: What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "A4:\n",
        "Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features. Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object using access modifiers, allowing controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5: What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "A5:\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python like __init__, __str__, and __add__ that allow operator overloading and object behavior customization.\n",

        "Q6: Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",

        "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to perform different tasks based on the object calling them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8: How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "A8:\n",
